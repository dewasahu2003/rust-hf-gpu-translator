 Here are some lines of the song Despacito in Spanish:  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Just thinking about it accelerates your pulse.  Yeah, I like it better than usual.  All my senses are asking for more  This must be taken without any haste.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Slowly.  I want to breathe your neck slowly.  Let me tell you things in your ear.  So you remember if you're not with me  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Slowly.  I want to undress you slowly kisses.  Sign on the walls of your maze.  And make your body a whole manuscript  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Up, up, up, up  Go up, go up.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  I want to see your hair dance  I want to be your rhythm.  Let's show him to my mouth.  Your favorite places.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Let me get past your danger zones.  Until I provoke your cries.  And forget your last name.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Slow  Let's do it on a beach in Puerto Rico  Until the waves shout, "Oh, blessed!"  So that my seal stays with you  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Step pasty, gentle softness  We're getting caught, little by little.  When you kiss me with that skill  I see you're gentlely malice.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Step to step, soft and soft.  We're getting caught, little by little.  And that's that beauty is a puzzle.  But to mount it here I have the piece  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Slowly.  I want to breathe your neck slowly.  Let me tell you things in your ear.  So you remember if you're not with me  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Slow  I want to undress you in kisses slowly  Sign on the walls of your maze  And make your body a whole manuscript  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Up, up, up, up  Go up, go up.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  I want to see your hair dance  I want to be your rhythm.  Let you teach him to my mouth.  Your favorite places  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Let me overtake your danger zones.  ♪ Till you scream ♪  And forget your last name.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Slow  Let's do it on a beach in Puerto Rico  Until the waves shout, "Oh, blessed!"
